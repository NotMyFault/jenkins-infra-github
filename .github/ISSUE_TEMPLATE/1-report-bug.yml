        Write bullet-point reproduction steps.
        Be explicit about any relevant configuration, jobs, build history, user accounts, etc., redacting confidential information as needed.
        The best reproduction steps start with a clean Jenkins install, perhaps a `docker run` command if possible.
        Use screenshots where appropriate, copy textual output otherwise. When in doubt, do both.
        Include relevant logs, debug if needed - https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/viewing-logs/
