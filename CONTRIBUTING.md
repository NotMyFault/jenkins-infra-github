Contributing to Jenkins Infrastructure
======================================

Our infrastructure is an open infrastructure project made by and for the Jenkins community.
In other words, it’s a contributors driven project. 
While we can’t share publicly everything like secrets, we try to be as transparent as possible so everybody can read, 
understand, improve our infrastructure without having privileged accesses.
If you have any idea that could help the infra or interest the community, feel free to make suggestions.

See the Contributing guidelines [on jenkins.io](https://jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/#contributing).
