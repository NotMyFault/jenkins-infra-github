Contributing to Jenkins Infrastructure
======================================

Our infrastructure is an open infrastructure project made by and for the Jenkins community.
In other words, it’s a contributor driven project. 
While we can’t share everything publicly (like secrets), we try to be as transparent as possible so everybody can read, 
understand, and improve our infrastructure without having privileged accesses.
If you have any idea that could help the infra or interest the community, feel free to make suggestions.

See the Contributing guidelines [on jenkins.io](https://jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/#contributing).
